# Separation of content and presentation

## We are HTML authors
We now know what HTML is. We know how to create a properly formatted HTML document, and we know how to browse the HTML documentation. We have everything we need to be HTML authors. Kind of.

## Writing HTML for humans
We want to design for humans. We want our work to function and read well. Writing HTML allows us to distribute our content or application to billions of people and our content will have an implied meaning based on what HTML tags we select.

If we stop here, our application will look incredibly spartan. We might also think that we traveled back to 1994. 

For the purposes developing HTML applications for humans, HTML is only half the equation. HTML provides structure and meaning. Now we need to customize and refine the esthetics using a visual styling language named CSS.

HTML is the content, structure, meaning. CSS is how things look, function and feel.
